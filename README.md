# Atlas of Disaster

Welcome to the repository for the **Atlas of Disaster**, an interactive web map developed for Rebuild by Design. This project leverages data from multiple sources to present an overview of disaster impacts at the county level across the United States from 2011 to 2023. Users can interact with the map to discover the number of disasters each county has faced and access information about their congressional representatives. This information is crucial for advocating for resilient infrastructure projects at both local and national levels.

## Mission

The mission of the Atlas of Disasters is to empower citizens, policymakers, and researchers with accurate and accessible geographical data on natural disasters. By making this information available and easy to understand, we aim to foster informed decision-making and encourage proactive measures towards building resilient infrastructure.

### Features

- **Interactive Map**: Users can click on any county or congressional district to view specific data about disaster occurrences and elected representative.
- **Data Layers**: The map includes separate layers for counties and congressional districts, which can be toggled on or off to customize the viewing experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The web map is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
